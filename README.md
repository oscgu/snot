# Snot

A simple notes taking app ;)

# WIP

Really needs a cleanup and some bugfixing. Use at your own risk!

## Config

A config file is created on first run. You can find it in the same

dir where you run it (for now...). There you can change your name

## Usage

Save a note:

`$ go run main.go note [topic] (title)`


Browse through notes:

`$ go run main.go view `
